Here are some of the things you will learn to do: 

• Use the browser’s development tools to implement sophisticated games  
• Create smooth, flicker-free animations  
• Scroll backgrounds and use parallax to create a 3D effect  
• Implement graphical objects, known as sprites, that you can draw and manipulate in a canvas   
• Detect collisions between sprites  
• Animate sprites to make them explode  
• Implement a time system that controls the rate at which time flows through your game   
• Use nonlinear motion to create realistic jumping  
• Simulate gravity  
• Pause and freeze your game  
• Warn players when your game runs slowly  
• Display scoreboards, controls, and high scores  
• Create a developer’s backdoor with special features  
• Implement particle systems to simulate natural phenomenon, such as smoke and fire  
• Store high scores and in-game metrics on a server with Node.js and socket.io  
• Configure games to run on mobile devices  

We discuss game development best practices throughout this book, starting here with seven that are specific to HTML5. 
1. Pause the game when the window loses focus. 
2. Implement a countdown when the window regains focus. 
3. Use CSS for user interface (UI) effects. 
4. Detect and react to slowly running games. 
5. Incorporate social features. 
6. Put all the game’s images in a single sprite sheet. 
7. Store high scores and realtime in-game metrics on a server.
