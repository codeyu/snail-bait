# snail-bait
Snail Bait is a classic platform game.   

The game’s main character, known as therunner, runs along and jumps between floating platforms that move horizontally.  

The runner’s ultimate goal is to land on a gold button that paces back and forthon top of a pulsating platform at the end of the game.

That button is guarded bytwo bees and a bomb-shooting snail. 

The runner, pulsating platform, gold button,bees, bomb, and snail are all shown in [Figure 1](#figure-1).

The player controls the game with the keyboard: 

* `d`  or  `←`  turns  the  runner  to  the  left  and  scrolls  the  background  from  left  toright.
* `k`  or  `→`  turns  the  runner  to  the  right  and  scrolls  the  background  from  rightto left.
* `j` makes the runner jump.
* `p` pauses the game.
